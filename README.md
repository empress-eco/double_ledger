## About The Project

### ðŸ“– Overview
Double Ledger Management is a user-centric application designed to automate and streamline ledger operations, particularly for parties that function as both suppliers and customers. By eliminating the need for manual entries, this tool significantly reduces human error, simplifying your financial operations.

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Automatic Journal Entries:** The app automatically creates a journal entry on submission of a purchase or sales invoice, debiting the supplier side and crediting the customer side.
- **Primary Nature Selection:** Users can define the primary nature of each party, whether they predominantly function as a customer or a supplier.
- **Efficient Error Handling:** If a purchase or sales invoice is canceled, the corresponding Journal entry is automatically canceled as well.

### ðŸ›  Built With
This application is built upon the robust and adaptable frameworks of the Empress Community.

## Getting Started
